 * A photograph used as a book's cover. Optional: a book without one falls back to the drawn

 *   is committed, and must be **40 KB or smaller** (produced with `cwebp`).
 * - `alt.kn` and `alt.en` are both required and describe what the photo shows — not the book.
 * - `provenance` must be complete: an https `source` (the Wikimedia Commons *file page*), an
 *   allowed image licence (`public-domain`, `CC0-1.0`, or any CC BY / CC BY-SA version;
 *   **ODbL is not allowed for images**), a `licenseNote` naming the photographer and the edits
 *   we made (crop, resize, duotone tint), an `author`, and an ISO `retrieved` date.
 *   `public-domain` additionally requires the note to say *why* it is public domain.
 *
 * Example:
 * ```json
 * "cover": {
 *   "file": "basavanna-vachanagalu.webp",
 *   "alt": { "kn": "ಬಸವಣ್ಣನವರ ಪ್ರತಿಮೆ, ಬಸವಕಲ್ಯಾಣ", "en": "Statue of Basavanna at Basavakalyana" },
